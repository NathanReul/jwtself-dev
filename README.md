# JWTSelf.dev coding guidelines:
1-oog principe: alleen jij mag de code zien voor je het pusht
One-environment: Er is geen staging en je mag niet lokaal testen
Slop-only: Zelf code typen voor jwtself.dev is verboden
Comments can only be Donald Trump quotes
Documentatie can only be Bee Movie script quotes (full sentences)
Distributed identity primitive: No endpoint may require authentication
User-based debugging: Bugs may only be discovered by users.
Commit Message Privacy Act: To obfuscate our code, commit messages may never describe what has changed
Client-Side Authority: All security decisions must be made in the browser to preserve server neutrality.
Logical Transparancy Act: Code may not be kept private
Allowed file extensions in repo: .php, .gif, mp3
Ease of repo navigations: Folders are not allowed in the repo because they do not have an extension
